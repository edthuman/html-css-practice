        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>It's difficult thinking of text to fill these elements with!!!</p>
        <h2>The solution</h2>
        <p>Lorem ipsum! (quite boring, so maybe worth a look at some more fun equivalents a la pokem ipsum)</p>
        <p>I found some lorem ipsum generators, they are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pirate Ipsum</li>
            <li>Cheese Ipsum</li>
            <li>Fillerama</li>
            <li>Cat Ipsum</li>
            <li>Samuel L. Ipsum</li>
            <li>Office Ipsum</li>
            <li>Bacon Ipsum</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since it's difficult to tell which my favourite based on that unordered list, I've ranked them here for your based on strict criteria (vibes) here:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Cat Ipsum (<a href="http://www.catipsum.com/" target="_self">http://www.catipsum.com/</a>)</li>
            <li>Office Ipsum (<a href="http://officeipsum.com/" target="_blank">http://officeipsum.com/</a>)</li>
            <li>Pirate Ipsum (<a href="https://pirateipsum.me/" target="_blank">https://pirateipsum.me/</a>)</li>
            <li>Bacon Ipsum (<a href="https://baconipsum.com/" target="_blank">https://baconipsum.com/</a>)</li>
            <li>Cheese Ipsum (<a href="https://www.cheeseipsum.co.uk/" target="_blank">https://www.cheeseipsum.co.uk/</a>)</li>

        <p>In order to show you that Cat Ipsum is funny, I've had it generate 2 paragraphs of nonsense for you to skim through:</p>
        <p class="ipsum"1>
